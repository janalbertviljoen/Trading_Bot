value_investing/holding.py
--------------------------
Buy and hold: a fixed amount at every decision (January and July) into its picks, never sold.

Each decision date, ``amount_usd`` buys the companies picked (``value_investing.
evaluation.ranked_positions``, buy side) at their weights; every purchase (a lot) is
held to ``end`` with dividends reinvested (``adj_close``). The same amount on the same
dates goes into each comparison (the index's benchmark first, then ``BRK-B``). An
investor who starts in a given year buys at every decision from then on, so a scenario
is the set of lots from its start year. ``rule_profile`` compares the rule points of the
picks that beat the index's benchmark since purchase with those of the picks that did
not.

Owns
----
The lots, the value over time per scenario and holder, the scenario summary, the rule
profile of winning and losing picks, and the wallet that also sells.

Must not
--------
Pick companies or weights (``value_investing.evaluation``); define returns
(``skatkis.financial_logic``); plot (``value_investing.plots``).

Public API
----------
BuyAndHold(lots, yearly, paths, summary)
    The results of ``buy_and_hold``.
buy_and_hold(positions, prices, *, compare, amount_usd, start_years, end)
    Lots, value over time and summary per start year.
rule_profile(lots, table, rule_ids)
    Dollar-weighted mean points per rule of the picks that beat the benchmark and of
    those that did not.
dollar_view(lots)
    Dollars ahead of the benchmark of the winning and losing picks, and the payoff ratio.
rule_weighting(lots, table, rule_ids)
    Per rule, its weights in the score against how well it told winners from losers.
weighting_quality(check)
    Rank correlation across rules of the weight with the gap and with the correlation.
Managed(trades, paths, summary, contents, holdings, purchases)
    The results of ``buy_and_sell``.
buy_and_sell(positions, shares, prices, *, threshold, amount_usd, start_years, end)
    The same yearly purchases, with holdings that score at or below a threshold sold
    in part and the proceeds reinvested.

Computes
--------
lot value, buy-and-hold value : buy_and_hold
    value(t) = a * L(t) / L(buy) for each lot of a USD bought on its decision date, L
    the ``adj_close`` level; a holder's value is the sum over its lots bought by t.
dollars ahead of the benchmark : buy_and_hold
    ahead = value(end) - a * (1 + b), a the USD invested and b the benchmark's total
    return from purchase to ``end``.
annualised excess of a pick : buy_and_hold
    ((1 + r) / (1 + b))^(1 / Y) - 1, r and b the pick's and the benchmark's total return
    from purchase to ``end``, Y the years between.
money-weighted annual return of a scenario : buy_and_hold
    ``skatkis.financial_logic.money_weighted_return`` of the yearly amounts and the
    value at ``end``.
weighting check, rule information coefficient over picks : rule_weighting
    Per rule: the mean rule weight w_r on the picks' score dates (overall, for the
    picks that beat the benchmark and for the others); gap = mean points of the picks
    that beat it - mean points of the others, each pick weighted by |ahead|
    (dollar-weighted); IC = Spearman correlation across picks of the rule's points and
    the pick's annualised excess.
weighting quality : weighting_quality
    Spearman correlation across rules of w_r with gap and with IC; above 0 the
    weighting favoured the rules that told winners from losers.
share sold, partial sale : buy_and_sell
    Each decision, a holding with score share s <= threshold t sells the fraction
    (t - s) / t of its units at that day's ``adj_close``; the proceeds and
    ``amount_usd`` buy the picks at their weights.
rule profile of winners : rule_profile
    Mean ``<id>_points`` on the score date, separately for picks with annualised excess
    > 0 and <= 0, each pick weighted by |ahead| (dollar-weighted).
dollar view of winners and losers, payoff ratio : dollar_view
    Per group (beat, lagged, all): number of picks, Σ ahead, mean and median ahead;
    payoff ratio = mean ahead of the winners / |mean ahead of the losers|.

    Holdings are counted in units of ``adj_close``, so dividends stay invested. At each
    decision the sales come first, then the proceeds and ``amount_usd`` buy the picks.
    A holding without a score on the score date is kept; money a missing price leaves
    unspent stays in cash. Only the new money counts as money put in; the
    money-weighted return uses it and the value at ``end``.
